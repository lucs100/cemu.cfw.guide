This can take some time, which causes small stutters in the game every time a new one is sent to the emulator.</p><p>Doing this asynchronously allows the emulator to run the process in the background. This means that when the shader is first called, it skips being rendered to the screen, and is instead stored for the next time it&#39;s used, providing a much smoother experience.</p><p>The video below shows loading Breath of the Wild for the first time using asynchronous shader compilation. After these shaders have been recompiled and cached, they won&#39;t need to be converted again, so the graphical glitches stop.</p><div class="custom-container tip"><p class="custom-container-title">TIP</p><p>You may need to update your graphics drivers to use this feature.

If another user has previously compiled the shaders, they can upload them for other users to import into Cemu.</p><p>If you&#39;re using OpenGL, you will only need to download the shader cache. If you&#39;re using Vulkan, you will need to download both the shader cache and pipeline cache. Shader caches work on each game regardless of its region, while pipeline caches are locked to the region of the game that they were generated on.</p><h3 id="vsync-matching" tabindex="-1"><a class="header-anchor" href="#vsync-matching" aria-hidden="true">#</a> VSync Matching</h3><p>Vulkan also allows us to use a new experimental VSync technique which allows Cemu to use the game&#39;s built-in frame-pacing instead.
